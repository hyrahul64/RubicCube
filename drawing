Normal cube with 6 different color has been drawn in windows 8

draw  rubic cube i.e 9 colors on each face

for each square we have to store 4 vertices. So 9*4= 36 
and for whole cube 36*6=216 vertices.

or we dont consider connected/common vertices, count will be 46.

Question is with this count(=46) can we draw rubic cube?

At any time maximum 3 faces visible and so we have to draw 9*3*2=54 triagle at any time.

Also implement mouse interaction to rotate whole cube.
